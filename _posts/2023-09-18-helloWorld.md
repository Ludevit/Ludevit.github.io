This is my fist post to my blog on github pages.

Here in this post i would like to give so thoughts on setting up github pages as well as Jekyll and Jekyll theme.

## Why make a Blog?

For some time i had an interest in hosting a website when where i would document my journey and my finding in regards to trying out new systems, languages and software. As this blog would serve me as some sort of a guide in case I forget how to use something or help other people that might be struggling with same issue that I encountered.

Also making a blog website is pretty nice way to learn how to write better English since it is not my fist language.

## Why Jekyll?

When I embarked on this journey to make a Blog website I had quite a lot of choices like using some JavaScript stack or maybe making my own tech stack in that regard you as a developer are usually spoiled for choices which can be quite overwhelming and this is just a start to all the things that you have to think about like hosting, OS, DNS, DDoS protection, ect...

And while those things are definitely something that i will be tackling on this blog.
Sometimes it is nice to have something that is just nice and ***simple*** to use and organize out of the box without worrying that one update might be a key to your impending doom.

This is why i chose **Jekyll** there are a lot of nice themes ready to use and deploy for free on Github Pages.

## Jekyll setup

Setting up Jekyll was pretty easy on my WSL2 Ubuntu instance all you have to do is just follow installation steps on jekyll installation guide for Ubuntu (or whatever system are you running).

* [Jekyll documentation for installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

when you are done installing Jekyll you have a choice of either making a theme yourself or just finding a free and opensource jekyll theme on github.

personally i went with pre-made theme called "Chirpy" by Cotes Chung because there was no point of reinventing the wheel for a blog site that is supposed to simple to use and maintain.

* [Chirpy repository on Github](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)

## Setting up Jekyll theme Chirpy

For setting up a Chirpy theme it is recommended to use theme on github called Chirpy starter.

* [Chirpy starter template](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter)

Once you open the link click on **Use this template** in the corner where you would normally get link for cloning a repository.

## Hosting on Github Pages

If you want to use github pages to host your jekyll website while using template make sure to use GITHUBNAME.github.io please make sure to change 'GITHUBNAME' with **your** github name! Otherwise it will not work.

* [Github pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

If you followed this correctly you now should now have a Github Pages website just copy name of the repository and paste it in to you browser.

## External Source

One source that really helped me with this process is YouTube video from **Techno Tim** where he goes through setup of jekyll and Chirpy theme.

* [Video from Techno Tim about deploying jekyll Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q)

So incase this blog post did not help maybe watch his video, it's really good.
