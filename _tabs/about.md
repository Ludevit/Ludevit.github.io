# This is Personal Blog website about Tech. üíª

Things that you can expect on this Blog are talks about Linux, FreeBSD, Programming in various languages and more.

Generally this blog is mostly about stuff that I'm doing at the time and serving me as a reminder on how to do things in case I forget or as a guide to other people that might somehow stumble on this obscure blog website.

## What Operating systems is this blog going to focus ‚ùì

Mostly on Linux and FreeBSD but I'm personally using variety of operating systems like WSL2 on Windows and other UNIX-like systems.

Also might be a good thing to point out that when it comes to Linux I will be mostly using RPM based distributions of Linux like Fedora, CentOS Stream or RHEL.

But I will try to use other Systems as well to see what they're about and write a blog post about it.

## Is this blog just about Operating systems and Programming ‚ùî

Mostly but not by the rule, I also have some plans to write blog posts about tech devices that I buy and make some "micro-reviews" so stay tuned.
